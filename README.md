A custom-built web app created to share movies offline over a local network. Designed to serve my neighborhood, the platform allowed friends to upload movies, add cover images, and download them without visiting each other physically. I hosted the app on my personal computer and set up a local Wi-Fi network. By connecting to the network and entering the server's IP and port in their browsers, users could access the movie hub from anywhere on our street. The system was fully offline and had an impressive range, making it a fun and efficient way to share media locally
